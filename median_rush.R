# This script determines median rushing yards for players with at least
# 20 carries during the 2014 NFL regular season.
# The final data frame is written as a csv file.
# A histogram of the median yards gained is made into a png.
# This script sources acquire_data.R and create_tidy.R to obtain the
# data and create a tidy data set of all rushing plays.
# See the README.md for an overview.

# Source acquire_date.R, which downloads the play-by-play data
# from the 2014 NFL Season. The data is then read into data frame.
source("acquire_data.R")

# Source create_tidy, which creates a tidy data set of all rushes
source("create_tidy.R")

# Create the final data frame of player statistics.
