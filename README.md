Analysis on the median rush distance of NFL players and teams during the 2014 regular season.

## Questions under analysis


## Data included in analysis
This analysis is performed using play-by-play data from the 2014 NFL regular season. The data was obtained from NFLSavant.com.

### Plays selected
The analysis was performed on plays classifed as "RUSH" and "SCRAMBLE" in the original data that were not "NO PLAY". Scrambles are included in the analysis because scrambles contribute to the traditional rushing box score and defenses prepare for this possibility in their schemes. "NO PLAY" means there was an accepted penalty that nullified the play.
